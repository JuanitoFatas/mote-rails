# Mote::Rails

mote-rails provides Mote generators for Rails 4+.

- [ ] When your Rails application loads, Mote will be loaded and initialized automatically
- [ ] Any time you generate a controller or scaffold, you'll get Mote templates (instead of ERB)
- [ ] Mote templates will be respected by the view template cache digestor

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mote-rails'

# or double quote if you prefer:

gem "mote-rails"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mote-rails

## Usage
